# Folder: `src/providers`

This folder contains the provider modules for the EWZ Codebase Next.js project. Providers are responsible for handling data fetching and state management within the application.

Each provider module represents a specific domain or functionality of the application and encapsulates the logic related to that domain. These providers can be used by different components throughout the project to access and manipulate data.

By organizing providers in this folder, we ensure a modular and scalable architecture for our Next.js project. It promotes separation of concerns and allows for easier maintenance and testing.

Feel free to explore the individual provider modules within this folder to understand their specific functionalities and how they contribute to the overall functionality of the application.
