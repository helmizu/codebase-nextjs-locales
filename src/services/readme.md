# Services Folder

The `services` folder in the `ewz-codebase-nextjs` project contains all the service modules used in the application. These services are responsible for handling various backend operations, such as making API calls, interacting with databases, and performing other business logic.

Each service module in this folder represents a specific functionality or feature of the application. These modules are designed to be reusable and modular, promoting code organization and maintainability.

By separating the service logic into individual modules, it becomes easier to manage and test different parts of the application independently. This folder serves as a central location for all the service-related code, making it convenient to locate and update specific functionalities.

Feel free to explore the different service modules in this folder to understand their purpose and how they contribute to the overall functionality of the `ewz-codebase-nextjs` project.
